There’s a growing chorus in the age of artificial intelligence that frames mastery as “learning how to prompt.” Books, tutorials, and courses are springing up everywhere promising to make you a “prompt engineer,” a “ChatGPT master,” or an “AI power user.”

But let me offer a different lens:  
**Learning how to use AI isn’t about mastering prompts. It’s about mastering *when* to use AI.**

If we’re going to live with AI—work with it, build with it, *think* with it—we need to understand it not just as a tool, but as a vehicle.

## The Car Analogy: A Change in Human Movement

AI is like a car. Before the invention of the automobile, humans walked, ran, or rode animals to get from one place to another. It was physically demanding, time-consuming, and constrained by your own body’s endurance. The car changed that. It allowed us to cover vast distances quickly and comfortably.

But the convenience came with a tradeoff. We stopped walking. We ran less. Over time, many of us grew weaker, more sedentary. The car expanded the horizons of what we could *do*, but it also diminished what we could *be*.

AI presents us with the same double-edged gift.

## The New Locomotion: From Thinking to Prompting

Where we once had to *think* deeply, write thoughtfully, and research diligently, we now have AI tools that can do it for us—or at least help dramatically. Want a business plan? ChatGPT can draft one. Need a marketing strategy? Ask Claude or Gemini. Want to debug code? CoPilot has your back.

These tools are, without question, vehicles. They get us to our destination faster, with less effort. And that’s incredible—until we realize we haven’t really learned the terrain we just crossed.

## The Artists Who Still Sketch

Here’s a contrasting example: artists and designers.

Digital illustration tools like Midjourney and DALL·E can generate concept art in seconds. Yet, many seasoned artists still sketch by hand. Not because they *have to*, but because they *want to*. The act of drawing builds muscle memory, refines intuition, and sharpens the eye.

They’re not refusing AI—they’re choosing when *not* to use it. They’re training the body, even while the car is parked in the garage.

## When to Walk, When to Drive

The critical shift we need in the age of AI is one of *judgment*, not just *technique*.

Knowing how to prompt ChatGPT is like knowing how to drive a Ferrari. But knowing *when* to use it—that’s wisdom. That’s discernment. That’s maturity.

Sometimes, you *should* walk:

- When you're writing a personal essay or memoir, and you want your authentic voice to emerge.
- When you're solving a tough math problem to develop deeper understanding.
- When you're exploring creative work, and the meandering path matters more than efficiency.

And sometimes, you *should* drive:

- When you need to draft 50 product descriptions in 10 minutes.
- When you’re brainstorming content ideas under a deadline.
- When you want to translate a concept into code you can build upon.

## Refining the Body in the Age of the Car

There’s a beautiful irony in this moment of acceleration: the more AI enables us to go further, the more valuable *manual expertise* becomes.

Consider chefs who still butcher their own meat or make pasta by hand. Or calligraphers who hand-letter with ink. Or engineers who still sketch circuits on paper before simulating them.

These people are like long-distance runners in a world of self-driving cars. They do it for precision, for self-discipline, for joy. They refine their bodies and minds, even when machines offer shortcuts.

## The Future: Hybrid Humans

The most powerful people in the AI era won’t be those who rely on it for everything. Nor those who reject it entirely. It will be those who move between walking and driving with fluidity.

They will know:

- When to let AI take the wheel.
- When to take the long, hard road on foot.
- When to do both—walk a path, then drive it faster with learned knowledge.

## Final Thought: Don’t Just Be a Passenger

If you only learn to prompt, you become a passenger in someone else’s vehicle. But if you learn when to *walk*, when to *run*, and when to *drive*, you remain the true navigator of your journey.

AI will carry many far. But those who train their minds and bodies alongside it?  
They won’t just go far. They’ll go deep. And they’ll go *well*.
